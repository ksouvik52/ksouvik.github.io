Hi! I am Souvik Kundu, Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from **University of Southern California**. My advisors were Dr. **Massoud Pedram** ([SPORT lab](http://www.mpedram.com/)) and Dr.  **Peter A. Beerel** ([eessc lab](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/)) . I am an Indian by birth. I did my M.Tech in Electronics (VLSI) Engineering from **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**. My technical interests include energy-efficiency, robustness, and privacy analysis and improvement of deep learning models used in computer vision and NLP applications, hardware accelerator architecture design for neural networks, in/near memory computing, computer  architecture.

I am extremely fond of long drive along pacific highway, traveling, playing and watching soccer and photography.
